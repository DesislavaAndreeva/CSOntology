Ontology of classification of the exsisting cybersecurity attacks
 
# General info

University evaluation project in Semantic Web

# Description

The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.

Protégé is used to define the ontology. Protégé is a free, open source ontology editor and a knowledge management system.

In computer and information science, an ontology is a way of showing the properties of a subject area and how they are 
related, by defining a set of concepts and categories that represent the subject.

# Details

The field of this ontology is the classification of existing cyber attacks. It includes different vulnerabilities, 
exploitation tools, the actions after a successful exploitation, the target groups for the attack, as well as the 
results of successfull attack.

The ontology could be used to classify the attacks in such a way that it is easy to determine what vulnerabilities 
led to the attack, what tools were used, what was the target group and what the damage from the attack was, which 
will help to take preventive measures and prevention of future similar attacks.

# The application

The project has super simple Java application that performs SPARQL queries over the ready ontology using Apache 
Jena framework (open source Semantic Web framework for Java). SPARQL is a RDF query language, a semantic query 
language for databases able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.
